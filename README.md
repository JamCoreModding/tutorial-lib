# JamCore Template Mod

This is the (opinionated) template used by JamCore to create our mods. The
repo contains an MIT license file for ease of use, as that's what our mods use,
but you are free to use the template without the license.

To automatically initialise the template, use [Deno](https://deno.land/),
and run the command `deno run -A --unstable scripts/template.ts`.

To see available properties, see `gradle.properties`.
